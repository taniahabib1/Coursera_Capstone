The dataset used for this problem is provided by the Seattle Police Department traffic records which consists of the severity of collisions which may happen at the intersection or mid-block of a segment. Each case has been assigned a severity label ranging from 0 which means unknown, 1 which means proper damage, 2 which means injury, 2b means serious injury and 3 is for fatality. The data has 37 input attributes ranging from information about a specific accident, location of the accident, collision type, number of vehicles including bicycles, passengers and pedestrians, total injuries, serious injuries and number of fatalities. Furthermore, there is information about the date, time and the location of collision. It has been further supplemented with details about the road, weather and light condition during the collision. The other notable attributes are bout the conditions such as whether the driver involved was under any drug or alcohol influence. Whether speeding and inattention was a factor, whether a pedestrian right of way was granted, and whether the collision involved hitting a parked car.  The miscellaneous attributes give details about collision code both at local and provincial level with description, lane segment and crosswalk keys.
